Personalized Greeting Generator
A simple command-line application built with Python that asks for the user's name and a friend's name, then generates a custom greeting.

Key Concepts Learned & Practiced
This project was a quick and effective way to practice the absolute fundamentals of Python:

User Input (input()): Learned to capture text-based input from a user in the terminal.

Variables: Stored the captured names into variables for later use.

Formatted Strings (f-strings): Used an f-string to dynamically and cleanly embed the stored names into a final greeting message.
