My Python & AIML Learning Journey
Welcome to my learning repository! I am using this space to document my journey as I build a series of Python projects, starting from the basics and moving towards concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This repository is for anyone who is also starting their coding journey. You can follow along, use the code for inspiration, and see how a project is built from the ground up.

How to Use This Repository
All projects are organized into their own folders. Each project folder contains the source code and a detailed README.md file explaining:

What the project does

The key Python concepts learned

How to run the code

Feel free to explore the folders to see the projects I've completed so far. My goal is to consistently add new projects and share my progress.
