# Python AIML Projects

A collection of small, beginner-friendly Python projects used to learn core Python concepts and explore introductory Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning ideas.

Each project lives in its own folder and includes a README explaining what it does, the key concepts demonstrated, and how to run it.

## Projects

- `calculator/` — Simple calculator examples in `calculator.py`.
- `contact-book/` — Small contact manager using `contacts.json` and `contacts.py`.
- `expense-tracker/` — Expense tracking examples stored in `expenses.json` with `tracker.py`.
- `gif-maker/` — Script that creates GIFs from images (`gif.py`).
- `guess-word/` — Word guessing game (`guess.py`).
- `quiz-game/` — Interactive quiz implemented in `quiz.py`.
- `todoapp/` — Basic command-line TODO application (`todoapp.py`).

If you see other folders, check their README files for details.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Python 3.8+ installed.

To run a project, open a terminal in the project folder and run the main script. Example (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd path\to\python-aiml-projects\guess-word
python guess.py
```

Replace `guess-word` and `guess.py` with the project folder and script you want to run.
