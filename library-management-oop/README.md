# Library Management System (OOP in Python)

## Project Overview
This is a simple Library Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The project demonstrates the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and method interactions to simulate basic functionalities of a library.

## Features
- `Book` class: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, and publication year.
- `User` class: Base class for users with attributes like first name, last name, and user ID.
- `Librarian` class: Inherits from `User`. Can add books to the library.
- `Member` class: Inherits from `User`. Can borrow and return books.
- Simple console print statements to show interactions like adding, borrowing, and returning books.

## How to Use
1. Run the `library_management.py` script (or equivalent file).
2. The script uses preset example objects to show:
   - Adding books by a librarian
   - Members borrowing and returning books
3. You can modify or extend the code to add new users, books, or features.
