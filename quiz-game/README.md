Simple Quiz Game
A command-line quiz application built with Python. This program presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, checks their answers, and provides a final score upon completion.

This project serves as a practical exercise in handling structured data and managing program flow in Python.

Features
Structured Quiz Data: Questions, multiple-choice options, and correct answers are neatly organized in a list of dictionaries.

Score Tracking: The program initializes a score at zero and increments it for each correct answer.

Interactive Q&A: The application loops through each question, displays the options, and waits for the user's input.

Instant Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to the user, indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect.

Final Score Summary: After all questions have been asked, the game displays the user's total score.

Key Concepts Learned
Data Structures: Mastered the use of a list of dictionaries to store complex, structured data in an organized and iterable format.

Control Flow (for loop): Used a for loop to iterate through the list of questions, ensuring each one was presented to the user.

Conditional Logic (if/else): Implemented if/else statements to compare the user's input with the correct answer and update the score accordingly.

User Input (input()): Captured and processed user input to drive the quiz.

String Manipulation (.upper()): Utilized the .upper() method to normalize user input, making the answer-checking logic case-insensitive and more robust.
