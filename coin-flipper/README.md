Coin Flip Simulator
A simple, interactive command-line application that simulates flipping a coin and displays the result. The user can flip the coin as many times as they want.

Features
Random Results: Utilizes Python's random library to provide a 50/50 chance of landing on "Heads" or "Tails".

Interactive Loop: The user can choose to flip again after each turn, creating an engaging loop.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and simple command-line interface that is easy to use.

Key Concepts Learned & Practiced
random.choice(): Learned how to use this function to randomly select an item from a list, which is a perfect and simple way to simulate a coin flip.

while Loops: Reinforced my understanding of using while True: to create a continuous program loop that can be exited based on user input.

User Input (input()): Practiced using the input() function to control the flow of the program (both to trigger the flip and to play again).

Functions (def): Organized the code into a clean structure with main() and coin_flip() functions for better readability.
