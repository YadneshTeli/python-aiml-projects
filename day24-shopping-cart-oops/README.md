# Python OOP Shopping Cart (Encapsulation Example)

This project demonstrates encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a simple shopping cart system in Python.

## Features

- `Product` class to represent items with a name and price.
- `ShoppingCart` class with private item storage.
- Public methods to add, remove, and list products, and to calculate the total price.
- Internal cart data is protected and only accessible through class methods.

## Features

- `Product` class to represent items with a name and price.
- `ShoppingCart` class with private item storage.
- Public methods to add, remove, and list products, and to calculate the total price.
- Internal cart data is protected and only accessible through class methods.

## How It Works

The cartâ€™s item list is private (`__items`), so it cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. All interactions (adding, removing, viewing items, and calculating total) are done through public methods, ensuring safe and controlled access.


```

## Concepts Practiced

- Encapsulation
- Class design
- Safe data access

Feel free to extend this project with more features like discounts, user authentication, or product categories!
