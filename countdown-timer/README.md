Countdown Timer
A simple command-line application built with Python that counts down in real-time from a user-specified number of seconds.

This project is a great exercise in controlling the flow of a program and handling user input gracefully.

Features
User-Defined Time: The user can enter any positive whole number of seconds to start the countdown.

Real-Time Countdown: The application pauses for exactly one second between each number, simulating a real-world timer.

Input Validation: The script uses a try-except block to ensure the user enters a valid, positive integer, preventing crashes from invalid input.

Key Concepts Learned & Practiced
The time Library: Utilized the time.sleep(1) function to pause the execution of the program for one-second intervals.

while Loops: Used a while loop to control the main countdown logic, continuing as long as the remaining time was greater than zero.

Error Handling (try-except): Implemented error handling to manage ValueError exceptions if the user enters non-numeric input.
