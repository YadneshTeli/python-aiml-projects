Secure Password Generator
A simple command-line application built with Python that generates a random, strong password of a user-specified length. This tool is useful for creating secure passwords for various online accounts.

Key Concepts Learned & Practiced
Built-in Libraries: Utilized Python's random library to choose characters unpredictably and the string library for easy access to character sets like letters, digits, and punctuation.

Data Validation: Implemented a while loop with a try-except block to ensure the user enters a valid integer for the password length, preventing crashes on invalid input.

String Manipulation: Combined multiple strings (string.ascii_letters, string.digits, string.punctuation) to create a comprehensive set of characters for the password.

List Comprehension & Join: Used a modern and efficient list comprehension (''.join(random.choice(all_characters) for i in range(length))) to build the final password string, which is a very common and "Pythonic" pattern.
