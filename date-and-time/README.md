Digital Clock
A simple command-line application built with Python that displays the current date and time.

This project was a quick and practical exercise to work with Python's built-in libraries for handling real-world data like dates and times.

Key Concepts Learned & Practiced
datetime Library: Utilized the datetime.datetime.now() function to fetch the current system timestamp.

String Formatting (strftime): Implemented the .strftime() method to format the raw datetime object into a clean, human-readable string for both the date (%Y-%m-%d) and the time (%H:%M:%S).

Importing Libraries: Practiced using the import statement to bring in Python's powerful built-in modules.

Functions: Organized the core logic into a clean display_current_time() function for better readability and structure.
