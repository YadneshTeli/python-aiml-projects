Mad Libs Generator
A fun, simple command-line game built with Python that creates a humorous story based on user-provided words. This project serves as a great exercise for practicing fundamental Python concepts in a creative way.

The application prompts the user for various types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) without revealing the story's context. It then inserts these words into a pre-written story template, resulting in a funny and often nonsensical narrative.

Features
Interactive Prompts: Asks the user for different categories of words to build the story.

Dynamic Story Creation: Uses an f-string to seamlessly embed the user's words into a story template.

Simple & Fun: A classic word game that's easy to play and demonstrates core programming skills.

Key Concepts Learned
User Input (input()): Mastered getting and storing different pieces of information from the user.

Variables: Practiced storing user input in clearly named variables.

F-Strings: Gained more experience with formatted string literals (f-strings) to dynamically and cleanly construct a new string from variables.
